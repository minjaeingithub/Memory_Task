### ðŸ§ª EXPERIMENT INTRO
Hi, I am Minjae Jo, a junior student @SungKyunKwan University. As a part of Undergraduate Research Program, I checked out human working memory(WM). In specific, whether discrete categories are decodable with EEG oscillations was the main topic. 



For 2 categories, human brain made a decoder(called as MVPA by J.R- King). Also temporal generalization was successful.


Speaking of tools I used, Brainstorm, Fieldtrip for preprocessing were used. For data analysis, I used ML model - Classification with Support Vector Machine(SVM).
Subject information is confidential, thus bare codes will be shared here. (Specific tunings are excluded)
FYI, I am especially interested in replay mechanisms in human brain. Further studies(including those I participate to), need to find out whether finding replay mechanisms with EEG is possible or not! Fingers crossedðŸ¤ž! 


### ðŸ’» CODE INTRODUCTION
This repository consists of two main parts of codes. First is experiment code, second is data analysis. Speaking of data analysis, I made a decoder for every time sample(100ms sliced). When training and test time were same, then cross-validation was done.
If you have any further questions or errors, please feel free to contact me.
